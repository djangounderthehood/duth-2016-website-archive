<blockquote>
<p>Published on 28th Feb 2018 by the DUTH team</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even when something has been great, sometimes you have to let go. We won't be organising more editions Django: Under the Hood.</p>
<p>When the first ideas were floated for a new conference, in a train in Italy somewhere in 2014, we weren't expecting how big of an event Django: Under the Hood would become. In our second year we sold out in 52 seconds. Over the years, we welcomed 750 attendees, provided over ‚Ç¨ 10.000 in financial aid to bring 30 people to the conference, and handed out 100.000 kcals in stroopwafels. But it wasn't just big in numbers, but also in how successful it was as a community event. Every year, we also worked hard to be inclusive, welcoming and safe for all attendees and speakers. </p>
<p>As we wrote last year, when we decided to take a break for 2018, organising a conference is exciting, fun, and a great learning experience. However, it also takes tremendous energy, involves stress, and sometimes disappointment. Especially as everyone on our team is a volunteer.</p>
<p>Since organising the last edition in 2016, we have all moved on to do different things in our lives, and focus our energy on other things that we feel passionate about. Therefore, we've decided not to organise further editions. We understand that that may come as a disappointment to some, but we'd encourage you not to be sad that it's over, but rather be happy that it happened.</p></div>

<blockquote>
<p>Published on 28th Feb 2017 by the DUTH team</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We've decided¬†to take a break from organising Django: Under the Hood in 2017.</p>
<p>For the last three years, we have organised Django: Under the Hood in Amsterdam. We started out with ‚Äúlet‚Äôs bring the core team together to share knowledge‚Äù, and ended up becoming one of the largest Django events in Europe. We‚Äôve always aimed to distinguish ourselves by having a short conference with in-depth curated talks. We also made increasing efforts every year to create an inclusive, welcoming and safe environment for all attendees and speakers.</p>
<p>Organising a conference like Django: Under the Hood is a tremendous effort. As organisers we are excited about our work every year. But this also takes a lot of energy, involves a lot of stress, and sometimes disappointment about what we haven‚Äôt been able to do. Every single person in our team does this as a volunteer effort. After three consecutive years, many team members want to take a break or devote their attention to new projects. Therefore the team has decided there will not be an edition of Django: Under the Hood in 2017.</p></div>

<blockquote>
<p>Published on 21st Nov 2016 by Agata Grdal, Baptiste Mispelon, Erik Romijn, Ola Sendecka, Rob Kirberich</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the most important parts of dealing with Code of Conduct issues is being transparent about what happened during the event. It is tempting to avoid talking about it and pretend that the event went without any problems, however we believe that this kind of approach does more harm than good.</p>
<p>By being transparent about what happened during the event, we aim to show that the Code of Conduct is taken very seriously by our team. This way we hope people will feel more comfortable to speak up if something's not right.</p>
<p>For this reason, we publish the transparency report: an anonymized description of the incidents that happened during the conference.</p></div>
