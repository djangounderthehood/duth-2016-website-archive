        <h2>For the first time sprinters</h2>

        <p>
            Sprints are a time of concentrated effort to make the Django project and its
            ecosystem better. We're going to improve Django and related projects.
            Can you do it? <strong>Yes!</strong> It's not hard, and we're here to help you if you get
            lost. The Django documentation has a
            <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/">good writeup on
                how to contribute</a> and we've prepared some tips to you get going.
        </p>

        <h4>Preparations</h4>

        <p>
            Start by <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/writing-code/unit-tests/#running-the-unit-tests">
            downloading the Django source code and running the test suite</a>. If
            you do this before the day of the sprints, that'll help you get a quick start, but
            if you run into trouble, you can get help during the sprints.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's also useful to <a href="index.html#sprints-what-to-do">look for a ticket</a> to work on before
            the first day of the sprints, so you'll have some time to think about the solution and, if
            it's a large feature, discuss the design on the
            <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/mailing-lists/#django-developers">
            django-developers mailing list</a>. Of course, you might get an idea of something to work on
            during the talks and that's fine too. It's advantageous but not required to find a ticket in advance.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to chat about ideas of things to work on, feel free to ping Tim Graham, the
            <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/fundraising/#fellowship-program">Django fellow</a>.
            He's contracted full-time by the Django Software Foundation to shepherd
            Django development and assist contributors. You can find him in the <a
                href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=django-dev">#django-dev IRC channel</a>
            as timograham. You can also email him at his address in the Django commit logs,
            especially if IRC is difficult because your time zone doesn't overlap much with his, EDT (UTC-4).
            That being said, there are Django contributors from all over the world who hang out in #django-dev,
            so don't limit yourself to asking Tim for advice.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you get the Django test suite running on your machine and find a ticket to work on,
            you should be ready to start coding! Remember, if you have problems along the way you can
            ask sprint organizers or other sprinters for help.

            If you want to know more, the Django documentation goes into more detail about
            <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/writing-code/unit-tests/">
                running the tests</a> and <a
                href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/writing-code/working-with-git/">
            working with GitHub</a>.

            <em>Django</em> is a big project and there's lot's of things you can do. Check out

        </ul>

        <p>
            You can use <a href="https://dashboard.djangoproject.com/">Django Development
            Dashboard</a> for browsing tickets by various predefined criteria. You can also take
            a look at a prepared <a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/LittleEasyImprovements">
            list of tickets needing patch improvements</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The sprints are a great opportunity to talk to fellow Django programmers, including members
            of the core team, so take advantage of it. Talk to people about what's your pain with Django.
            Pair with someone on a ticket: two pairs of eyes are better than one. Don't be afraid to ask
            questions, and don't give up!
        </p>

        <p>
            When you're ready to create a pull request, check your patch with the
            <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/writing-code/submitting-patches/#patch-review-checklist">
            patch review checklist</a>, then ask a friend to review your patch. If all looks good,
            the friend can mark the ticket's "Triage State" as "Ready for checkin". Someone from the Django team
            will take a final look at the patch and merge it if all looks good. Don't worry if your patch isn't
            merged during the sprints. In fact, we don't usually merge a lot of patches during sprints because
            there are many more people writing patches than reviewing them, and members of the Django team
            are more effective during a sprint providing high level advice to many people rather than doing
            a few detailed code reviews. Get your patch to "Ready for checkin" status, then bang the gong to
            celebrate your success!
