    <p>
        <em>Django: Under The Hood</em> will take place in the center of
        Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
    </p>

    <h3>Getting to Amsterdam</h3>
    <p>
        Amsterdam Schiphol Airport (AMS) is very close to Amsterdam itself, and many direct flights
        are available. From the airport, you can take a train to Amsterdam Centraal which departs at least
        three times per hour and should take about 15 minutes. A single use ticket costs ‚Ç¨ 5.
        Note that Amsterdam Centraal is often not
        the first stop of the train, so make sure you get out at the right station. Always buy a ticket
        before boarding the train.
    </p>
    <p>
        Amsterdam also has good international rail connections to Belgium, France and Germany. Some
        sleeper trains are available to other destinations.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Hotel</h3>
    <p>
        Most speakers and core developers are in the <a href="http://www.volkshotel.nl">Volkshotel</a>, a bit southeast
        of the center, right next to the Wibautstraat metro station. There is a metro station right in front of the
        door, with metro's running to the center and Central Station very regularly.
    </p>

    <h3>Getting around</h3>
    <p>
        For an overview of locations and transit, see
        <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=z8CUz5dbiMQo.k9BSlCl6_KRs">our overview map</a>.

    <p>
        The conference venue is Pakhuis de Zwijger, on Piet Heijnkade 179.
    </p>

    <p>
        Walking is always an option in Amsterdam, but the conference venue is about 25 minutes walking from
        the train station and your hotel is probably even a bit further away.
        You might prefer to take a tram. You can also rent a bike: bike rental is available
        from many different shops in the city center.
    </p>
    <p>
        Amsterdam has an extensive public transit network, mostly consisting of trams. There are also buses and
        a small metro network. Most are run by GVB, see their
        <a href="http://www.gvb.nl/ovinmamsterdam/tourist/Pages/Tourist-guide-English.aspx">tourist guide</a> for more
        information.
    </p>
    <p>
        All public transit in the Netherlands uses the <em>OV-chipkaart</em>. For both GVB and trains you
        can buy single use paper tickets (with a chip inside, don't fold) at ticket offices, some shops and from the
        driver, but it may be cheaper to buy
        a normal prepaid OV-chipcard. These cost ‚Ç¨ 7,50, and you will have to top it up: you'll need at
        least ‚Ç¨ 4 credit to travel with GVB. All this is a lot more hassle, but will make your trips cheaper
        than buying a single use card every time. Whether the ‚Ç¨ 7,50 is worth it, depends on how much you
        intend to travel.
        In ticket shops, you can also buy 24- or 48-hour cards.
    </p>
    <p>
        A few other notes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            If you buy a ticket on a bus or tram, you can only pay cash in not too large change - definitely no
            larger than ‚Ç¨ 20.
        </li>
        <li>
            Ensure you always check in and out: at the door in a tram or bus, when you exit the station
            for a metro or train. Not checking out may invalidate a single use ticket, and will cost a lot extra
            on normal chipcards.
        </li>
        <li>
            In trams, the doors do not open when you check out. There is a green button on either side of
            the door to open it.
        </li>
        <li>
            The paper single use cards are only valid for one transport company: a GVB 24-hour card will not
            work on trains or on a Connexxion bus, though you're unlikely to encounter the latter.
        </li>
        <li>
            Most transit stops somewhere between 0:00 and 1:30, but there are night buses. They have separate pricing:
            no other cards are valid. The easiest way to travel is to buy a card on the bus for ‚Ç¨ 4,50.
            The ticket will allow you to transfer into another bus. Some night buses only run once an hour.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Visa requirements</h3>
    <p>
        Depending on your nationality, you may need to request a Schengen visa in advance.
        See the <a href="http://www.government.nl/issues/visa-for-the-netherlands-and-the-caribbean-parts-of-the-kingdom/short-stay-visas-for-the-netherlands">Dutch government visa website</a> for more information.
        We can provide invitation letters if needed.
        If you do need a visa, make sure you request one as soon as possible.
